Some find the JW Library media window a little difficult to manage when using 3rd-party applications such as
VLC and OnlyM to display images or videos that aren't included in JW Library. The media window is sometimes lost 
during transition between applications and occasionally the year text disappears.

JwlMediaWin changes the behaviour of the JW Library media window so that it is not minimized whenever another 
application opens a window on the media display. The JW Library application code is not modified, rather 
UI Automation is used to transform the media window (i.e. it performs functions you _could_ do manually).
